-- FS25 Soil & Fertilizer - MATERIAL DOWN (SF-43)
-- =========================================================
-- The ground remembers how long cut material has been lying on it.
--
-- A farmer knows the swath went down Tuesday. Nothing in the game does. This adds
-- one 8-bit value-map layer holding HOW MANY DAYS material has lain at each spot,
-- aged by ONE filtered engine call per day, born when a machine is observed making
-- material, and cleared when the material genuinely leaves.
--
-- It makes NO farming rule of its own. The hay member reads it later and asks the
-- one question nothing else in the game can answer: how many days has this been
-- down - or refuses to say.
--
-- ENCODING (materialAge, minVal 0 / maxVal 254 so one raw step is exactly one day):
--   raw 0   = NO RECORD. Bare ground. Never ages into a record.
--   raw 1   = born today (0 full days down).
--   raw 255 = AT OR PAST THE CEILING. A REFUSAL TO RULE, never a value.
--
-- THE ONE DIRECTION THIS DESIGN FORBIDS is age looking FRESHER than it is. Every
-- rule below that seems fussy - the movement inheritance, the no-periodic-wipe
-- rule, the merge filter - exists to close a laundering path.
--
-- SERVER ONLY. The layer is excluded from MP sync and never allocated client-side
-- (SoilValueMaps asks 4+5, coupled). Bands cross to clients by event when the
-- reading surface ships; that surface is a later member and is not built here.

}

-- NOTE ON MEADOW_WINDROW, because it is the one key here that is NOT an engine
-- fill type name and a later reader will otherwise "correct" it back out.
--
-- FS25 ships exactly three windrow fill types: GRASS_WINDROW, DRYGRASS_WINDROW and
-- a generic WINDROW. Mowing a meadow drops GRASS_WINDROW, by the converter at
-- maps_fruitTypes.xml:61 (from="MEADOW" to="GRASS_WINDROW"). There is no
-- MEADOW_WINDROW anywhere in the engine.
--
-- The birth gate never sees that fill type. It is handed a name SYNTHESIZED from
-- the FRUIT type by fruitTypeToWindrowName (HookManager.lua:115-119), which builds
-- FRUITNAME .. "_WINDROW", so mowing a meadow arrives here as "MEADOW_WINDROW".
-- This row is what admits it. Without the row, meadow mowing is refused at birth,
-- which is the 396-tracked-against-86-not-tracked split the live test produced.
--
-- This is SAFE because the name is used at the gate ONLY: noteMaterialAt tests it
-- and then writes an age band to a material-blind layer, so "MEADOW_WINDROW" is
-- never persisted and never read back. Spoilage (MaterialWetness) and the hay
-- member resolve the material at COLLECTION time from the fill type actually
-- picked up, which is the real GRASS_WINDROW and already has its rules.

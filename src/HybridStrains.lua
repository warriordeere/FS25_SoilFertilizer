-- HybridStrains.lua - CD-10: hybrid disease types (multi-mode resistance strains).
--
-- A player can currently dodge the resistance consequence by rotating modes, and nothing
-- punishes building resistance in several modes at once. This is that consequence: ground
-- pushed past the threshold in two or more modes can breed an infection no single chemical
-- answers well.
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT: a second concurrent infection. `field.activeDisease` is a hard scalar and
-- CD-10 does not change its shape -- a hybrid id rides it exactly as every other disease id
-- does, and is opaque to every existing reader (severity, discovery, save, sync, DairyCore).
-- It is also not a reading surface; the player learns about it through CD-11's contract.
--
-- THE ONE THING THAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO SHIP: F66. Built against the unmetered resistance
-- build, this would have fired on almost any two-mode spray pass rather than as an earned
-- seasons-long consequence, inverting the entire design intent. That was a HARD build-order
-- gate (Steward CD10-C1) and it cleared with b60677f8.

-- ── Eligibility (the threshold arithmetic) ────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Resistance scores are NOT on a universal 0-1 scale: a synthetic mode's ceiling is 10, a
-- natural's is 5. HYBRID_THRESHOLD is a FRACTION of each mode's OWN ceiling, never an
-- absolute score. Comparing a raw score against 0.7 would fire on almost every mode almost
-- immediately.
--
-- Worked: two synthetic modes gate at >= 7.0 each. A synthetic paired with a natural gates
-- the natural side at >= 3.5 and the synthetic side stays >= 7.0.
--
-- THE CEILING COMES FROM ResistanceBands.ceilingForMode, NOT from isNaturalFungicide(mode).
-- The CD-10 brief's own loop shape said the latter; it is a type error (that function takes a
-- fill-type NAME like "SULFUR", while field.resistance is keyed by MODE like "M2"), it
-- returns nil for every mode, and every mode would have read the SYNTHETIC ceiling. The
-- corrected mapping is per CHEMICAL and lives in RESISTANCE.NATURAL_MODES -- note M3
-- MANCOZEB is multisite yet synthetic, so an "M-prefix means natural" test is wrong too.
---@param field table
---@param mode string
---@return boolean
--
-- THE EPSILON, and it is not fudge. Resistance accrues as ~50 tiny additions per boom pass,
-- so a field that has had exactly the design's number of full passes lands a hair BELOW the
-- threshold rather than on it: measured, 14 passes gives 6.999999999999895 against a
-- threshold of 7.0, short by 1.05e-13. Without tolerance the hybrid fires one pass later
-- than the arithmetic says, and anyone tuning HYBRID_THRESHOLD would find the numbers did
-- not mean what they read. The epsilon is relative and ~1e-9 -- eleven orders of magnitude
-- below the smallest change a player could ever perceive, and far above accumulated drift.

-- ── The re-onset cooldown ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--

-- is one real month whatever the month length setting.
--
-- The expiry is PERSISTED (one int on the existing per-field save), and that is a
-- deliberate, flagged departure from the brief's "no new persisted state". A cooldown that a
-- save-and-reload defeats is not a cooldown -- it would silently do nothing, which is worse
-- than not shipping it. It is not synced: onset is server-side only and no client ever
-- computes it, so a client has no use for the value.

-- ── THE RULED CONTROL FACTOR (2026-07-30, Arissani delegated) ─────────────────────────
--
-- The problem it closes, between two individually correct designs: CD-12 scores a blend's
-- control as the MAX over its partners, and a hybrid's brand-new category defaults every
-- chemical to 0.25. Composed, a blend would answer a hybrid no better than one fresh jug --
-- which defeats the hybrid's entire reason for existing.
--
-- The factor: scale the catalog multiplier by min(1, freshModesApplied / requiresModes),
-- where a FRESH mode is one whose resistance on this field is BELOW the eligibility
-- fraction. A single fill contributes one mode; a blend contributes its partners' DISTINCT
-- modes; a burned partner contributes nothing fresh.
--
-- Worked: single fresh jug 0.5x, blend spanning two fresh modes 1.0x, blend with one burned
-- partner 0.5x, two partners sharing one mode 0.5x.
--
-- THE ZERO CASE, and the reading matters. The bench bar says a blend of two burned partners
-- "scores 0x fresh scaling" but that "the base 0.25 category default still applies unscaled
-- by ruling, so the spray is poor, never zero-by-arithmetic". Multiplying by zero would
-- contradict the second half, so zero fresh modes means the factor is NOT APPLIED rather
-- than applied as 0. The spray is still correctly inert in that case -- CD-9's own
-- max-over-partners resistance penalty zeroes it, which is the right mechanism for it and
-- keeps this factor from being a second, hidden way to reach zero.

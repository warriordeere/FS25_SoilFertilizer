--- Single gate for player-facing "bypass" tools - editors that let a player rescale
--- or override the simulation (Crop Tuning Editor, Constants Tuning Editor). These are
--- allowed on Simple difficulty ONLY. On Realistic and Hardcore the simulation is meant
--- to be lived with, not tuned around, so these tools are hidden/refused. Keep every
--- bypass feature routed through THIS one predicate so the policy lives in a single
--- place rather than being re-derived per panel.

--- Force every "simpleOnly" (soften) setting back to its schema default when the current

--- Simple would carry its softened value into Realistic/Hardcore: greying only DISABLES
--- the control, this makes the stored value itself honest. Deterministic (schema defaults
--- are identical on every peer) so server and clients converge with no extra broadcasts.
--- Mutates fields directly and never calls save() (avoids recursion - save() calls this).

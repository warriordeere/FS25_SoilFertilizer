-- DURATION SCALING (SF-31 / #740)
-- ========================================
-- The absolute chemical day-counts (fungicide/herbicide/insecticide) are tuned
-- against a reference season length. On a short 1-day-month save an absolute
-- 35-day fungicide would cover ~3 game years (the #639/#740 problem), so at the
-- application sites those counts pass through SoilDuration.seasonScaled(), which
-- reads days-per-period from Time Guard's context and scales:
--     effectiveDays = max(1, round(baseDays * daysPerPeriod / REFERENCE_DPP))
-- A save at REFERENCE_DPP days-per-month is unchanged; shorter saves scale down.
-- REFERENCE_DPP is the days-per-month the shipped duration constants were tuned
-- against (Tyson's ruling, 2026-07-23). Time Guard absent -> the absolute count.
-- EXCLUSIONS (already season-honest, must NOT double-scale): the organic
-- TRANSITION_DAYS (year-normalised via Time Guard) and the fallow threshold
-- (multiplied by daysPerMonth at its read site).

-- DEFAULT FIELD VALUES
-- ========================================
-- These defaults are calibrated to match the base game's initial field state:
--   pH 6.0  → "slightly acidic" in our system, consistent with base game "needs liming" at game start
--   N/P/K   → "fair" range (below optimal), consistent with base game "needs fertilizing" at game start
-- Players address both systems simultaneously: apply lime → base game lime state + our pH both rise;
-- apply fertilizer → base game fertilizer state + our N/P/K both rise.
-- Fields already saved in soilData.xml are not affected; only new/untracked fields use these values.

-- FIELD VARIATION (initial soil diversity)
-- ========================================
-- Spread applied to a fresh field's starting nutrients so the map isn't uniform.
-- Two components are summed (see SoilFertilitySystem:getOrCreateField):
--   • REGIONAL - a smooth low-frequency gradient over the farmland centre, so
--     neighbouring fields share a similar profile and the map forms believable
--     good/poor regions (this is what answers "no variability", issue #632).
--   • NOISE - per-field jitter that decorrelates individual fields within a region.
-- N/P/K amounts are fractions of the base value; pH/OM are absolute units.
-- "Dramatic" spread (#632 follow-up): widened so fields differ enough that you
-- should inspect a field before buying it. Some land is genuinely poor, some rich.
-- Regional gives believable good/poor REGIONS; noise decorrelates fields within them.

}

-- ========================================
-- CULTIVATION (shallow tillage - non-plowing passes)
-- ========================================
-- WEED_PRESSURE_REDUCTION set to 100 so a single full cultivation pass fully clears
-- weed pressure (the hook fires per-area tick, clamped to 0 by math.max).
-- Agronomically correct: shallow tillage disrupts annual weed seedlings entirely;

}

-- ========================================
-- STRIP-TILL / RIDGE TILLER
-- ========================================
-- Strip-till (e.g. Orthman) tills narrow 6-8" deep knife-bands (~30% of
-- field surface).  Surface residue stays in the untilled zones, so:
--   • Weeds: LESS effective than full cultivator (partial coverage)
--   • Pests: MORE effective than cultivator (deep knife disrupts soil larvae)
--   • Disease: LESS than cultivator (residue left on surface → spore habitat)
--   • No pH normalization (no soil layer inversion)
--   • OM: modest net gain per pass - its residue incorporation (below) less its
--     light oxidation (OM_DYNAMICS.OXIDATION.STRIP_TILL). The old separate OM_BOOST
--     (+0.10/pass) was RETIRED into this single residue+oxidation gradient (#738), so
--     strip-till has one gain term and one loss term like every other tillage type.
--     Its generosity is preserved by its LOW oxidation (0.02), not a bloated gain.
-- The RidgeTiller FS25 spec (processRidgeTillerArea / RIDGEFORMER work area)
-- is completely separate from Cultivator.processCultivatorArea, so a dedicated
-- hook is required.
SoilConstants.STRIP_TILL = {
    WEED_PRESSURE_REDUCTION    = 15,  -- pts; less than cultivator (partial surface coverage)
    PEST_PRESSURE_REDUCTION    = 12,  -- pts; more than cultivator (deep knife action)
    DISEASE_PRESSURE_REDUCTION = 10,  -- pts; less than cultivator (residue left in place)
    -- OM_BOOST retired into the residue+oxidation gradient (#738). No pH normalization.
}

-- ========================================
-- RESIDUE INCORPORATION (Issue #338)
-- ========================================
-- When post-harvest tillage works stubble and straw residue back into
-- the soil, it decomposes and releases a small amount of organic matter
-- and nutrients (especially N and K from cereal straw, P is minimal).
-- Each tillage type has its own incorporation efficiency:
--   Plow      : deepest incorporation - highest OM and N release
--   Cultivator: shallow mixing - moderate OM release, small NPK
--   Strip-till: partial surface coverage - lowest incorporation
--   Sowing    : direct-drill openers disturb minimal residue
--
-- All values are per-pass additive boosts (on the 0-100 scale for N/P/K,
-- and on the 0-10 OM scale). They are small by design - straw residue
-- decomposes over weeks/months, so a single tillage pass incorporates
-- only a fraction. The plowingBonus setting gates the plow path; all
-- other paths are gated by the new residueIncorporation setting.
--
-- Agronomic reference (Midwestern US extension, kg/ha per tonne of straw):
--   Cereal straw typically contains: N=6, P=0.8, K=12, C=430 (kg/tonne)
--   OM contribution ≈ 40-50% of straw C converted to stable humus over 1+ yr
--   A single tillage pass incorporates ~30-60% of surface residue.
--   At 4-6 t/ha straw (wheat/maize at game scale), that translates to:
--   Plow:      OM+0.12, N+0.8, P+0.1, K+0.6  (60% incorporation efficiency)
--   Cultivator:OM+0.06, N+0.4, P+0.05,K+0.3  (30% incorporation)
--   Strip-till: OM+0.03, N+0.2, P+0.02,K+0.15 (15% - only tilled strips)
--   Direct-drill: OM+0.02, N+0.1, P+0.01,K+0.08 (10% - opener disturbance only)

-- ========================================
-- Working a STANDING or dead crop into the soil - green manure, an over-wintered
-- cover crop, a failed/burned crop, or a tall stubble - releases far more organic
-- matter and nitrogen than tilling bare soil. This is applied ON TOP of residue
-- incorporation, and ONLY when a crop is actually detected at the work position
-- (via a FieldState query in the onStartWorkAreaProcessing probe, before the tool
-- clears the fruit). Values below are the maximum per full-field pass at full crop
-- biomass; they are scaled by the crop's biomass factor (0..1, from growth state)
-- and the processed area fraction. Gated by the existing residueIncorporation setting.
--
-- Agronomic basis: incorporating a green-manure / cover crop (e.g. oilseed radish,
-- mustard, clover) returns the whole standing biomass to the soil - typically several
-- tonnes/ha of fresh matter - versus only surface straw for stubble residue.

-- mass. Two independent terms, scaled by soil moisture:
--   * SURFACE  ∝ ground contact pressure ≈ tire inflation pressure. Wide/flotation/
--     aired-down tyres spread the load → low pressure → little surface packing.
--   * SUBSOIL  ∝ axle load (regardless of tyres). ~10 t/axle damages subsoil; <5 t/axle
--     does not. This is the permanent-damage term a big tyre can't avoid.
--   * MOISTURE multiplier: wet soil compacts far worse ("hydraulic ram"); dry soil resists.
-- The numbers in SoilCompactionModel are calibrated against the contact-pressure
-- references in those sources (e.g. a 1360 kg car on tiny patches ≈ 827 kPa).

-- SoilBlends.lua - CD-12: THE TANK MIX.
--
-- A farmer can buy eight physical fungicides and spray any one of them. He cannot spray two
-- at once, which in real disease management is the most important thing he would do: a mix
-- of two modes of action stops either one from carrying the whole selection pressure.
--
-- A fill type cannot be created at runtime, so every mix a player can ever hold must exist
-- at load. That constraint is the right architecture rather than merely the permitted one:
-- the fungicide consequence chain carries only the fill type NAME, so a self-describing
-- name is the only form that cannot part company from the liquid it labels when a tank is
-- saved, split, transferred or sold.
--
-- THE LOAD-BEARING RULE OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM: registration for a crop-protection fill type
-- spans nine or more sites across two files, and missing one is INVISIBLE -- an uncalibrated
-- rate looks like it works; a missed density-map remap means no ground state is ever
-- written at all. So nothing here is hand-maintained. This table is the one source of truth
-- and every list is derived from it by a loop.
--
-- Loaded immediately after Constants.lua: it reads PHYSICAL_FUNGICIDE_ORDER and writes the
-- derived entries back into SoilConstants, so every later module sees a complete picture.

-- ── Build the 28 pairs from the eight shipped chemicals ───────────────────────────────
--
-- The key is BLEND_ plus the two partner names in ALPHABETICAL order, so exactly one key
-- exists per unordered pair.
--
-- THE VALUE IS AN EXPLICIT LIST AND IS NEVER PRODUCED BY PARSING THE KEY. Both names are
-- in hand before the key is built, so they are stored directly. This matters:
-- COPPER_HYDROXIDE contains an underscore, so BLEND_COPPER_HYDROXIDE_SULFUR cannot be
-- split on "_" -- a parser would read it as COPPER + HYDROXIDE + SULFUR. A lookup cannot be
-- mis-parsed.
--
-- EVERY PAIR EXISTS AND THERE ARE NO REFUSALS, including the two earlier drafts refused:
-- same-FRAC pairs (propiconazole + tebuconazole, both group 3) are resistance-neutral under
-- the partner-count divisor and better on spectrum, and organic-plus-synthetic pairs are
-- legal to MAKE and correctly break certification when sprayed.

--

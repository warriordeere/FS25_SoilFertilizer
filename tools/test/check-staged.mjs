// Parse the exact files git is about to commit, with luaparse pinned to Lua 5.1.
//
// WHY NOT REUSE tools/test/syntax-check.mjs: its findLuaFiles() defaults to SRC_DIR,
// so it never sees main.lua at the repo root - the entry point of several mods in this
// suite. A gate that misses the entry file is worse than no gate, because it grants
// false confidence. This checks the STAGED set instead, which is by definition exactly
// what is shipping, wherever it lives in the tree.
//
// Lives in tools/test/ (not tools/git-hooks/) because node resolves bare imports from
// the SCRIPT's directory upward - from tools/git-hooks it never sees tools/test/node_modules.
// Usage: node check-staged.mjs <abs-path>...

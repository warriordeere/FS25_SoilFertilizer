-- CD-9 simulates resistance and persists it four ways; no client could ever see it
-- (F67: `resistance` occurred zero times in NetworkEvents.lua). This is the fifth path.
-- The contract these assertions hold:
--   * the server bands, the client reads; a raw score never crosses the wire
--   * UNKNOWN is a value, not an absence, and never degrades to WORKING
--   * unscouted ground never publishes a band at all

-- resistance_f68_relief_test.lua - F68 (the durability dial) and the F66 save relief.
--
-- F68: MAX_NATURAL looked like it made sulfur and copper more durable and did NOT. The
-- ceiling multiplies the build, divides the penalty and scales the bands, so it cancelled in
-- all three and both families saturated in exactly 20 passes. A constant that reads like a
-- dial and moves nothing is worse than a missing feature. The dial now lives on the build
-- rate, which is the only place the difference can land.
--
-- F66 relief: CD-9 shipped 2026-07-29 with a build that counted every boom section as a
-- full application. The meter landed 2026-08-01, but the damage is PERSISTED. Arissani
-- ruled the player should not stay burned by a choice the bug made for him.

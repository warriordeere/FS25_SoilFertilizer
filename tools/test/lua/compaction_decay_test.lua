-- compaction_decay_test.lua - persistence of compaction recovery (nemrod153 Discord report).
-- Natural decay and taproot bio-drilling shave points off the field-average compaction.
-- The average is DERIVED as compactionSum / compactionTotalCells, so the old code (which
-- only lowered field.compaction) was silently wiped the instant onCompaction /
-- onSubsoilerPass re-derived the average from the untouched compactionSum - that is the
-- nemrod153 "radish decompaction reset the moment I started subsoiling" report.
-- _applyCompactionDecay must fade compactionSum AND every zoneData cell so the recovery
-- survives a later per-cell rewrite.

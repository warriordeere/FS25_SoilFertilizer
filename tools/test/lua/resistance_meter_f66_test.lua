-- resistance_meter_f66_test.lua - per-MOA resistance build metering (CD-9 / F66).
--
-- F66: the resistance build in onFungicideAppliedDirect had no per-pass meter while both
-- sibling consequences in the same function did. The hook is an appended function on
-- Sprayer.onEndWorkAreaProcessing and lands once per boom SECTION per FRAME ("1000+ times
-- per spray pass"), so a bare increment of BUILD_PER_APPLICATION * maxRes saturated a mode
-- inside the first second of the first pass; since the penalty is (1 - score/maxRes), the
-- fungicide dropped to zero effect partway through the pass the player was spraying.
--
-- The fix restores the dose_factor term the ratified CD-9 design specified: the increment
-- scales by liters / targetVol, exactly as every other consequence in that function does.
--
-- These assertions are load-bearing for CD-12, which changes this same expression to
-- BUILD_PER_APPLICATION * maxRes(partner) / #partners. Halving a saturated build is not a
-- feature, so the meter has to still be here when the tank mix lands.

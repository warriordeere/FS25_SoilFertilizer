-- yard_ladder_sf46_test.lua - THE YARD LADDER (SF-46).
--
-- The member that holds a per-bale CONDITION row, walks it up a shelter ladder once
-- per day, and ends it in one condemnation event. These assertions are written the
-- house way: they pin the failures that would otherwise be SILENT, not the happy path.
--
-- Four of them exist because the first cut of this member got them wrong, and every
-- one of those four would have shipped green under a call-count test:
--
--   * THE TOKEN IS NOT THE NODE ID. Scenegraph node ids do not survive a save. A
--     nodeId token orphans every row on reload, hands each bale a fresh condition,
--     and leaves the dead rows in the savegame forever. Nothing in game would have
--     looked wrong for the first hour.
--   * NO TRANSIENT REACHES THE LEDGER. MaterialDown:serialize copies records
--     wholesale, so a live Bale reference parked on a row goes to the serializer.
--   * BIRTH WETNESS IS NOT LADDER UNITS. Seeding condition from the seasonal stub
--     would open a winter bale at 75 of a 100 ceiling and blow both ruled horizons.
--   * A REFUSED READ IS NOT A VALUE. It falls to the stub; it never becomes a zero.
--
-- The horizon assertions at the end are the balance guard: if someone retunes a rate
-- without retuning the thresholds, the ruled "about a wet week / about 2.5 wet weeks"
-- stops being true, and that is the assertion that says so.

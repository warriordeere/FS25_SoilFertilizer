## From the ecosystem audit (Arissani)
- [x] Resolve Point 8 (ProStaff silent bridge): decided no bridge now; baseline v3 "already consumed" claim to be corrected by Claude(A) to planned-not-built.
- [ ] Confirm getFieldInfo should stay the sole companion read path; verify CropDisease and DairyCore call it (not `soilSystem.fields`) during their audits.
- [ ] Decide whether getFieldInfo exposes FieldSentry state or companions keep reading `g_currentMission.fieldSentry`.

## Bugs
- [x] 2026-07-26 bug sweep (54 total across ecosystem): SoilFertilizer bugs fixed and merged to main. See GitHub issues #748-#757 for individual tracking. All closed.
- [x] Oilseed-radish nitrate by direct drill (issue #778): the crop-incorporation probe never ran on seeders, so terminating a cover crop with a direct drill (Väderstad Proceed V24) awarded only the flat DIRECT_DRILL residue and the nitrate HUD read "unchanged". Fixed by installing the #674 crop-biomass probe on `SowingMachine`, threading `_sfCropBiomass` into `onSowing`, and awarding the new `CROP_INCORPORATION.SOWING` profile (OM 0.4 / N 2.0 / P 0.4 / K 1.2) after the residue block, gated on `residueIncorporation` and biomass > 0. 20 assertions in crop_incorporation_sowing_778_test.lua. **Merged to main in PR #781.**
- [x] Tractor side-tank NPK credit (issue #780): the credit died silently once the planter's liquid tank drained - `getActiveSprayType` returned nil, `getSprayerFillUnitIndex` fell back to a wrong-but-valid local unit (seed tank / second product tank), and `resolveSprayerFillTypeIndex` returned that local product, failing the nutrient-profile check. Fixed with an external-source guard (`wap.sprayVehicle ~= sprayer` -> wap.sprayFillType is authoritative) plus a recognized-product fallback to `wap.sprayFillType` with a debug log in the sprayer hook. 9 assertions in resolve_sprayer_filltype_780_test.lua. PR open.
- [ ] None open from the audit. Track new ones from GitHub issues here.

## Features / enhancements
- [x] Release gate (2026-08-02): the stable-vs-experimental lock. `ReleaseGate.lua` holds Arissani's certified lock set (CD-9 resistance, CD-10 hybrids, CD-12 tank mixes, ground material, spatial soil, Read the Dirt all LOCKED); `Settings:allowsExperimentalSystems()` is the explicit opt-in, orthogonal to difficulty. Experimental console commands (SoilResistance, SoilResistanceTest, SoilBlendCheck, SoilMaterialBench) refuse when locked, mirroring bypassLockedMsg(). New settings-panel row + SoilRelease status command + Release Gate dialog from the version dialog. **Sim wiring done same day:** the locked systems' entry points are gated - MaterialDown/Wetness/HayBet/YardLadder + spatialScouting only arm when their system is live (bridges gated too); SpatialPressures:run and the CD-9 resistance build / CD-10 hybrid onset / CD-12 blend handling only run when their system is live. Fail-open when settings unreadable. 68 assertions in release_gate_test.lua.
- [x] Variable pest and disease pressure (SF-19): outbreaks start in a patch and grow instead of one number per field. `SpatialPressures.lua` runs from the daily pass (server-only) after the field aggregate settles: ORIGIN picks weighted cells when pressure rises (disease: per-cell soil adapter incl. compaction as the 4th input; pest: edge-distance weight), SPREAD is seed-and-stamp single-hop-per-day with anti-saturation as an exclusion and a half-field ceiling guard. The key-not-invertible discipline holds (positions from live grid arithmetic via gx/gz, never decoding). Relief-weight coupling stance pinned: adapter reads the STORED OM while that feature is unbuilt. 22 assertions in variable_pressures_sf19_test.lua.
- [x] The kneel (SF-37): the active, precise reveal verb. Kneel (Shift+K) at a spot and the exact cell enters knowledge. `SpatialScouting:revealCellAt(connection, x, z, day)` writes one cell onto the walked mask, server-authoritative, LAW 4 (client key press = request carrying only x,z; farm from the requesting player's record via `playerSystem:getPlayerByConnection`). `SoilKneelEvent` carries the request. The field-level scout fee path stays byte-identical for spotless callers. 11 assertions in kneel_sf37_test.lua.
- [x] The handful read (SF-38): the frozen payload contract the Read the Dirt panel renders. `HandfulRead.assemble(ctx)` builds one payload from getters that all ship, per-clause grain + gates, zero writes. Material verdict takes the fill type from the caller (the layers are material-blind); diseaseKnown is cell-grain via the walked mask when a fresh cell exists. 35 assertions in handful_read_sf38_test.lua.
- [x] Spatial scouting walked mask (SF-26): on-foot walking reveals the trouble's pattern where you walked, per farm, fading after N in-game days. `SpatialScouting.lua` owns the per-farm mask (own home, LAW 2), samples server-side from the authoritative player list on foot only (LAW 1 + LAW 4), ages via Time Guard, persists via StateLedger with an own-XML fallback, delivers through NetworkSync (LAW 3: each entry carries {cell, walkDay, sampledTruth}), and composes at read time in SoilMapOverlay so the shared mirrors stay identical for every farm. Re-hide generation gate keeps pre-re-hide walks from resurrecting (acceptance 4). 38 assertions in spatial_scouting_spec_test.lua.
- [x] Ground-material family (SF-43 to SF-49, from #749): age layer + object ledger (SF-43), wetness + water record (SF-49), hay conversion + tedder hook (SF-44), straw swath (SF-45), bale condition ladder (SF-46). Merged to main in PR #767. Material birth wired at HookManager.lua:2749 and :3100. Reading surface (SF-48, Wizard) deferred by ruling.
- [x] CD-9 disease resistance family: F66 per-pass meter fix, CD-11 resistance data contract (four sync paths), CD-12 tank mix (28 blends), F68 durability dial (BUILD_RATE_NATURAL 0.25), saturated-save relief, CD-10 hybrid strains. Merged to main in PR #772. CD-11 readout (Wizard) still pending.
- [x] Refined per-pixel value-map engine (WizardlyPayload's #736): adopted and folded into development (cd871bd7). Four merge-review fixes landed with it: migration coord fix, skipped-day batch-tail simulation, undiscovered-disease display-map gate, and the SoilMapOverlay semantic review. Per-cell spray now paints the value maps instead of the field average (#735). Our simulation kept on top of the storage engine.
- [x] Organic certification multiplayer sync (81d7f9d8): state serialized on every field path, fixing the co-op client wipe. Backed by an ephemeral 3-state status-map layer painted at cert changes (a54098f1) and surfaced as map layer 12. Answers the ecosystem organic-cert MP-sync open call.
- [x] No-till organic-matter dynamics (#738, f0f5aab8): per-tillage oxidation gradient + fenced no-till daily credit; the flat OM_BOOST retired.
- [x] Rotation planner v1 (#739): data surface publishes lastCrop3 + rotationBonusDaysLeft and blesses getCropFamily + the candidate pool (db315d5e); the in-menu rotation planner dialog ships on top (#744) alongside the FarmTablet app.
- [x] Short-month rain fill (#740, 790bc345): synthetic weather presets reshaped into a month-length effective-climate fill (short seasons get a rain top-up instead of drying out).
- [x] Harvest contract underwrite (#741, 02074f1d): stateless getCompletion override divides out the yield modifier so soil-reduced yields still let harvest contracts reach 100%.
- [x] Season-scaled chemical durations (SF-31, 9d624aef): fungicide and effect durations normalize on Time Guard's daysPerPeriod (REFERENCE_DPP=3).
- [x] Unscouted disease indicator (cb29b018): an unscouted field reads UNKNOWN rather than clean green (the first half of the progressive disease reveal below).
- [x] Compost amendment-burn cap (bed49d9c): finished compost caps at COMPOST_MAX, gentler than fresh slurry/manure. Pest/disease retune (#737) so thresholds are reachable and the strict tillage order holds.
- [x] Six physical fungicides (Propiconazole/Azoxystrobin/Boscalid/Mancozeb/Metalaxyl/Tebuconazole): buyable + sprayable IBC tanks routed into the catalog control math; kept in scout/recommend but gated out of instant-apply via `PHYSICAL_FUNGICIDES`. Shipped 2.4.7.0, verified in-game (buy / spray / scout). Kit data discarded as duplicate; SF catalog reused. (Sulfur/Copper extend the same way + `ORGANIC.APPROVED_INPUTS` when A-side's brief lands.)
- [x] Network event round-trip test harness (`tools/test/lua/network_events_roundtrip_test.lua` + mock stream in prelude): single-machine serialization desync coverage for all 13 events. The substitute for the two-machine MP test.
- [ ] NetworkSync v2 delta path: `onWriteDelta`/`onReadDelta` on SoilNetworkSyncBridge (send only changed fields).
- [ ] ProStaff fertilizer discount silent bridge (when scheduled): pcall-guarded `proStaffManager:getFertilizerDiscount(farmId)` as a cost multiplier at the fertilizer cost site.

## Cross-mod integration
- [x] StateLedger bridge (`SoilFertilizer_Soil`, delegate-when-present).
- [x] NetworkSync bridge (`SoilFertilizer_Sync`, whole-field-map).
- [x] MasterHUD bridge (soil HUD draw stack via subscribe).
- [x] SettingsHub bridge (settings mirrored for FarmTablet System Settings app).
- [ ] Lock module ids `SoilFertilizer_Soil` and `SoilFertilizer_Sync` with Claude(A) before release (persistence + wire keys, never rename after ship).
- [~] Two-machine MP sync test of the bridges: the LIVE two-machine test is out of scope (no dedicated-server budget). Substituted by the network round-trip harness (serialization desync coverage for all events) + single-host smoke. Ledger 2026-07-15.

## Docs / localization
- [ ] Keep all 26 languages in step for any new setting or fill type.
- [ ] Update SoilVersionDialog CHANGELOG + README version on every release.

## Blocked / waiting on
- [!] getFieldInfo FieldSentry-state decision (waits on: audit answer).
- [!] ProStaff discount bridge (waits on: ProStaffCoOp handle confirmed + SF cost hook site scheduled).
